# 《 Day 2 》(DATE :- 26-06-2025)
Today Is my second day of # (TRAINING CSE 15 DAYS)
I studied today what is booting and its types,what is Kernel and it manages,what is shell its types and categories and Linux file structure and commands Then, I practice question 
# first question is (What is Booting and its types)?
Ans :- Booting is the process of starting a computer or electronic device and loading the operating system into the main memory (RAM) from the storage device (like HDD,SSD or ROM)
## Types of Booting
there are two main types:
# 1. Cold Booting(Hard Booting)
# * Defination: 
When the computer is started from a completely powered-off state.
# * Example:
Turning on your PC or laptop after it was shut down.
# * Process:
Power -> BIOS/UEFI loads -> OS loads into RAM
# 2. Warm Booting(Soft Booting)
# * Defination:
Restarting the computer withpout turning off the power
# * Example:
Pressing the "Restart" button or using Ctrl+Alt+Del on windows
# * Used When:
Software installs require reboot or suystem is lagging

#  Second question is (What is Kernel and it manages)?
Ans :- the kernel is the core part of an operating system.
it acts as a bridge between hardware and software.
it directly manages the system's resources like CPU,memory,and input/output devices
kernel is like a chef
# Third question is (What is Shell its types and categories)
Ans :- -> A shell taker user commands and passes them to the OPERATING SYSTEM(OS) to perform task like file management,Process cantrol
-> Shells can be command line interface(CLI) or graphical user interface(GUI),through the term typically refers to CLI

# 《 Day 3 》 (DATE :- 27-06-2025)
My third day in (training CSE 15 days)
I studied about Bare Metal installation,Partioning schemes its Types,File and Dictionary Permission,Types of command,Redirection,Pipes its types,Shell Program
# Bare Metal Installation :-
1. Bare metal installation directly using USB(pen drive)
2. Direct installation in computer hardware

# Redirection:
## .Allow you to change input or output of combined
## .Echo hello > day3.txt
## .Redirect the message from hello to day3.txt
## .Operations -> (standard output), >> <(standard input)
# Pipes:
## .Take output from one command and pass it to another command
## .Particular file in folder
## .Example: you have many files in folder but you want only file that ends with .sh
## Types of Pipes:
# .Pipes are two types

Today I studied about Hardware Introduction,RAM(Random Access Memory),ROM(Read Only Memory),Hardisk,Resistor,Specification of System,DVD,CD,Floppy Disk,Power Supply,Cache Memory,Modulator,UPS(Uninterruptible Power Supply),PSU(Power Supply Unit),SMPS(Switch Mode Power Supply),LCD(Liquid Crystal Display),HDMI port,VGA,Satta Port,Cumos,Motherboard,NIC(Network Interface Card),Chipset and In Linux operating System(OS) I studied about (Command) Like Gzip Command,Wildcard(GLOBBING),Assignment :- Escape Character.
# -> Introduction(HARDWARE):
#### -> Hardware means the physical parts of a computer that we can see and touch.
It includes all the equipment and devices connected to the computer.
## .Examples of Hardware:
-> Monitor – to see the output
-> Keyboard – to type input
->Mouse – to move pointer and click
->CPU (Central Processing Unit) – the brain of the computer Printer, Scanner, Speaker, etc.
## .Types of Hardware:
1. Input Devices – used to give data to the computer (e.g., keyboard, mouse)
2. Output Devices – used to show the result (e.g., monitor, printer)
3. Processing Devices – do the actual work (e.g., CPU)
4. Storage Devices – save data (e.g., hard disk, pen drive)

# -> What is RAM(Random Access Memory)?
#### -> RAM stands for Random Acess Memory.
It is a temporary memory of a computer where data and programs are stored only while the computer is ON.
##### In Simple Wording:
RAM is like a notebook where your computer writes things it is working on right now.
Once the computer is turned off, everything in RAM is deleted.

->RAM is fast memory.

->It stores data temporarily
.
->More RAM = Faster computer performance.

->It helps in running apps, games, and software smoothly.

## Example:
If you open a game or a browser, it loads into RAM so your computer can work on it quickly.

# What is ROM(Read Only Memory)?
#### -> ROM stands for Read Only Memory.
It is a permanent memory in a computer that stores important instructions that do not change and stay safe even when the computer is off.
##### In Simple Wording:
-> ROM is like a book that the computer can only read, not write on.
It stores the startup instructions (called BIOS or firmware) that help the computer turn on.

->ROM is non-volatile (data does not delete when power is off).

->It is read-only, so users cannot change its data easily.

->It stores essential programs needed to boot the system.
## Example:
When you turn on your computer, the instructions in the ROM help it start properly.

# What is Hard disk?
#### -> A Hard Disk (or Hard Drive) is a storage device used in computers to save data permanently.
##### In Simple Wording:
A hard disk is like a cupboard where all your computer files, photos, videos, software, and documents are stored.Even when the computer is turned off, the data in the hard disk stays safe.

->It stores data permanently.

->It is slower than RAM, but can hold much more data.

->It is usually inside the CPU cabinet.

->Data is stored in the form of magnetic patterns.
## Types of Hard Disk:
1. HDD (Hard Disk Drive) – has spinning disks, slower, cheaper.

2. SSD (Solid State Drive) – no moving parts, faster, costlier.
## Example:
If you save a video today, it is saved on the hard disk, and you can open it tomorrow, next week, or even after a year.

# What is a Resistor?
#### -> A Resistor is a small electronic device used to control the flow of electric current in a circuit.
##### In Simple Wording
A resistor slows down the electric current, just like a speed breaker slows down traffic.It protects other parts in the circuit from too much current.

-> It is used in almost all electronic circuits.

-> It has two wires (legs) and comes in different colors and sizes.

-> The value of resistance is measured in Ohms (Ω).

-> Color bands on the resistor show its resistance value.
## Example:
If an LED light needs low current, a resistor is used with it so the LED does not burn out
