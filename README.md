# 《 Day 2 》(DATE :- 26-06-2025)
Today Is my second day of # (TRAINING CSE 15 DAYS)
I studied today what is booting and its types,what is Kernel and it manages,what is shell its types and categories and Linux file structure and commands Then, I practice question 
# first question is (What is Booting and its types)?
Ans :- Booting is the process of starting a computer or electronic device and loading the operating system into the main memory (RAM) from the storage device (like HDD,SSD or ROM)
## Types of Booting
there are two main types:
# 1. Cold Booting(Hard Booting)
# * Defination: 
When the computer is started from a completely powered-off state.
# * Example:
Turning on your PC or laptop after it was shut down.
# * Process:
Power -> BIOS/UEFI loads -> OS loads into RAM
# 2. Warm Booting(Soft Booting)
# * Defination:
Restarting the computer withpout turning off the power
# * Example:
Pressing the "Restart" button or using Ctrl+Alt+Del on windows
# * Used When:
Software installs require reboot or suystem is lagging

#  Second question is (What is Kernel and it manages)?
Ans :- the kernel is the core part of an operating system.
it acts as a bridge between hardware and software.
it directly manages the system's resources like CPU,memory,and input/output devices
kernel is like a chef
# Third question is (What is Shell its types and categories)
Ans :- -> A shell taker user commands and passes them to the OPERATING SYSTEM(OS) to perform task like file management,Process cantrol
-> Shells can be command line interface(CLI) or graphical user interface(GUI),through the term typically refers to CLI

# 《 Day 3 》 (DATE :- 27-06-2025)
My third day in (training CSE 15 days)
I studied about Bare Metal installation,Partioning schemes its Types,File and Dictionary Permission,Types of command,Redirection,Pipes its types,Shell Program
# Bare Metal Installation :-
1. Bare metal installation directly using USB(pen drive)
2. Direct installation in computer hardware

## .Echo hello > day3.txt
## .Redirect the message from hello to day3.txt
## .Operations -> (standard output), >> <(standard input)
# Pipes:
## .Take output from one command and pass it to another command
## .Particular file in folder
## .Example: you have many files in folder but you want only file that ends with .sh
## Types of Pipes:
# .Pipes are two types

##### Simple Explanation:
The chipset works like a traffic controller.It manages the flow of data between the CPU, RAM, hard disk, USB ports, and other devices.
-> Found on the motherboard

-> Helps the CPU communicate with memory, storage, and input/output devices

-> Made up of two main parts (in older systems):

1. Northbridge – Connects CPU to high-speed devices like RAM and graphics card


2. Southbridge – Connects to slower devices like hard drives, USB, and sound cards
# (For Linux Operating System):
## COMMANDS:
###### -> Gzip Command :-  
The gzip command is used to compress files to save space.
##### Simple Explanation:
gzip reduces the size of files (especially large text files) to save disk space and make them easier to share or transfer.It creates a .gz file (compressed file).
## 👉 This will compress filename and create filename.gz
## 👉 The original file will be removed by default.
## Common gzip Commands:
-> gzip file.txt	Compress file.txt to file.txt.gz
-> gzip -k file.txt	Compress but keep original file
-> gzip -d file.txt.gz	Decompress (unzip) the file
-> gunzip file.txt.gz	Same as above (another way to decompress)
-> gzip -r foldername/	Compress all files in a folder, recursively
## Example:
gzip notes.txt
Result: notes.txt.gz is created, and notes.txt is removed.

# PCU (Personal Computer unit):
Installation & Hard Disk Preparation:
#### Partitioning:
The first step of Partitinong is to organize the hard disk into: Primary (C: Drive):

Where the Operating System (Windows/Linux/Unix) is installed.

Avoid storing personal/important files in C-Drive
## Diagram of PCU(Personal Computer unit):
![Diagram-of-a-personal-computer](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/93e985a4-9afd-429b-ad42-00a2b4d625d3)
### Why C-drive?
Because , In case ,If Windows crashes, files in D,E,F-Drive are safer and can often be recovered. if we put files in same Drive then there will be Data loss if window get crashed.
## Diagram of C-drive:
![copyImage](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4ae261af-7ab9-42d0-a129-59ffc09196bc)
#### Logical Drives (D:, E:, F:):
######   Used for pictures, videos, documents, etc.
###### performace regression /Slow performance :
-> The speed of system slowed down due to some reasons like ; memory full, less RAM, Viruses.

this issues can be resolved by using system efficiently , and use antiviruses .

-> Keeping the files and Documents in Desktop also make system slow , so keep the files and folders out of Desktop.

-> Taskbar: keep taskbar clean . close the apps which are not in use.

-> Bookmarks: Booksmarks also slows down the speed . because system keep running them in background .

-> Temporary files : The files that get created by default during web browsing are temporary files . These can also be the cause of slower performance.

while web browsing some websitespermmision to accept cookies by which these temporary files are created.

-> Malvares : keep your system updated and scan for viruses every month atleast.

### Concept of Optimisation:
Optimization means making something as good, efficient, or effective as possible.

###### In the computer world, it often refers to:

Speeding up software or hardware so it runs faster or uses fewer resources
-> Improving algorithms to solve problems more efficiently

-> Reducing energy use in devices or systems
## Diagram of Optimization:
![copyImage](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3274d987-0bd3-4fd6-bbf9-a991c4f64fcc)
#### DEFRAGMENTATION:
Defragmentation is the process of reorganizing fragmented data on a hard disk so that related pieces are stored close together. This improves file access speed and overall system performance on traditional HDDs. It’s not needed for SSDs, which use a different method called TRIM.

#### DRIVERS:
Drivers are software that let the operating system communicate with hardware like printers, keyboards, or graphics cards. Without them, hardware won’t work properly.

### ISSUES FACED WHILE USING PRINTER:
Here’s a compact list of common printer issues and how to fix them:

##### 1.Printer not printing

-> Cause: Connectivity issues or outdated drivers
-> Solution: Check cables/Wi-Fi, restart printer and PC, reinstall or update drivers
##### 2.Paper jams

-> Cause: Misaligned or poor-quality paper
-> Solution: Gently remove jammed paper, align guides, use recommended paper type
##### 3.Low ink warnings (even when ink remains)

-> Cause: Inaccurate ink sensors
-> Solution: Keep printing until quality drops; replace only when necessary
##### 4.Slow printing

-> Cause: High-resolution settings or complex documents
-> Solution: Lower print quality settings, use draft mode for basic prints
##### 5.Poor print quality

-> Cause: Dirty print heads or low 
-> Solution: Run print head cleaning utility, check ink levels
##### 6.Printer offline

-> Cause: Network or driver issues
-> Solution: Reconnect to network, set printer as default, restart spooler service
# BSOD(Blue Screen Of Death):
It is used to indicate a system crash, in which the operating system reaches a critical condition where it can no longer operate safely.

#### Common Causes of BSOD:

##### 1.Hardware Failures:
Faulty RAM, hard disk, or other internal components
##### 2.Driver Issues:
Outdated, incompatible, or corrupted device drivers
##### 3.Corrupted System Files:
System file corruption due to improper shutdowns, malware, or failed updates
