# Traning cse 15 days(Name :- Jatin Kumar,Branch :- CSE(c2),CRN :- 2415147)
In this I will share my experience and what I have learn in my 15 days training on daily basis
# 《 Day 1 》(DATE :- 25-06-2025)
Today Is My first day in (CSE 3rd sem Training)
In first day of Training I learned about linux operating system,difference between linux and window and how to download Linux
# * firstly I studied Linux operating system Introduction (like Linux is a free and open source OPERATING SYSTEM (OS) Kernel widely used as the foundation for various operating system,often referred to as distributions and It was discovered by (Linus Torvalds) in (1991)
# * secondly I studied difference between Linux and window

| Feature              | **Linux**                                            | **Windows**                                         |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| **Cost**             | Free or open-source (mostly)                         | Paid (requires license for full version)            |
| **Source Code**      | Open source (you can see and modify the code)        | Closed source (only Microsoft can modify)           |
| **Customization**    | Highly customizable (change almost everything)       | Limited customization                               |
| **Security**         | More secure (due to fewer viruses and threats)       | More vulnerable (more common target for malware)    |
| **User Interface**   | Command-line or graphical (depends on the distro)    | Mostly graphical (Windows GUI)                      |
| **Software Support** | Software available but fewer mainstream options      | Supports a wide range of software, including games  |
| **Hardware Support** | Works well on older hardware and lightweight systems | Requires more powerful hardware for modern versions |
| **System Stability** | Very stable, less prone to crashes or slowdowns      | Can be prone to crashes or system slowdowns         |
| **System Updates**   | Manual updates (user control) or automatic           | Regular automatic updates, but can be intrusive     |
| **Command Line**     | Widely used, powerful (Terminal)                     | Available but less common and less powerful         |
| **File System**      | Uses EXT4, Btrfs, etc. (open source)                 | Uses NTFS (proprietary)                             |
| **Gaming**           | Limited compared to Windows (though growing)         | Excellent support for gaming (largest game library) |
| **Popularity**       | Widely used in servers, developers, tech enthusiasts | Most popular for general desktop use, businesses    |
| **Performance**      | Often faster and more efficient                      | Can be resource-heavy, especially with new versions |
# * Thirdly I studied ,How to download Linux OPERATING SYSTEM(OS)
Step1 
# -> Search (ORCALE VIRTUALBOX) meaning is (VIRTUALBOX is free and open-source software that allows users to run multiple operating systems on a single computer simultaneously)
#    
        -> Visit the official website:
        https://wwww.virtualbox.ord/
#
        -> Then download the version(Windows host)
Step2   -> 
# -> Search (MICROSOFT VISUAL C++ REDISTRIBUTABLE 2019) meaning is (The MICROSOFT VISUAL C++ 2019 REDISTRIBUTABLE is a package of runtime components that are required to run applications built using MICROSOFT's C and C++ libraries)
#       
        -> visit the official website:
        https://learn.microsoft.com
#      
        -> Then,click X64 to download
Step3   
# -> Search (UBUNTU) mening is (UBUNTU is a popular,free and open-source Linux distributionb Known for its user-friendliness and versatility,widely used for desktop and server environments.)
#
        -> visits the official website:
           https://ubuntu.com/
#
        -> Click desktop
#  
        -> Then download IOS file of UBUNTU
# PRODUCT BASED COMPANIES
     -> Develop and sell their own products
     -> Example :- Google,Amazon,Adobe
# SERVICE BASED COMPANIES
     -> Those that help customers and clients solve their problems
     -> Example :- TCS,Infosys,Wipro
# 《 Day 2 》(DATE :- 26-06-2025)
Today Is my second day of # (TRAINING CSE 15 DAYS)
I studied today what is booting and its types,what is Kernel and it manages,what is shell its types and categories and Linux file structure and commands Then, I practice question 
# first question is (What is Booting and its types)?
Ans :- Booting is the process of starting a computer or electronic device and loading the operating system into the main memory (RAM) from the storage device (like HDD,SSD or ROM)
## Types of Booting
there are two main types:
# 1. Cold Booting(Hard Booting)
# * Defination: 
When the computer is started from a completely powered-off state.
# * Example:
Turning on your PC or laptop after it was shut down.
# * Process:
Power -> BIOS/UEFI loads -> OS loads into RAM
# 2. Warm Booting(Soft Booting)
# * Defination:
Restarting the computer withpout turning off the power
# * Example:
Pressing the "Restart" button or using Ctrl+Alt+Del on windows
# * Used When:
Software installs require reboot or suystem is lagging

#  Second question is (What is Kernel and it manages)?
Ans :- the kernel is the core part of an operating system.
it acts as a bridge between hardware and software.
it directly manages the system's resources like CPU,memory,and input/output devices
kernel is like a chef
# Third question is (What is Shell its types and categories)
Ans :- -> A shell taker user commands and passes them to the OPERATING SYSTEM(OS) to perform task like file management,Process cantrol
-> Shells can be command line interface(CLI) or graphical user interface(GUI),through the term typically refers to CLI
# Types of Shell

# 《 Day 3 》 (DATE :- 27-06-2025)
My third day in (training CSE 15 days)
I studied about Bare Metal installation,Partioning schemes its Types,File and Dictionary Permission,Types of command,Redirection,Pipes its types,Shell Program
# Bare Metal Installation :-
1. Bare metal installation directly using USB(pen drive)
2. Direct installation in computer hardware
# Partioning Schemes :-
1. Divide a hard disk into separate divison
2. Each Section acys like a independent disk
## Types of (Partioning Schemes) :-
###
| Partitioning Type | Easy Example                       | Good For                 |

| Round-Robin       | One by one in order                | Equal load without logic |
# File and Dictionary Permission:-
They cantro who can do what with files and folders(directories)
## Types of Permissions :-
###
| Permission | Meaning (for folders)                   |
| ---------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `r`        | You can **see the file names** inside.  |
| `w`        | You can **add/delete files** in it.     |
| `x`        | You can **enter** (cd into) the folder. |
# Types of Users:

| --------- | ------ | -------------------- |
| File Type | `-`    | Regular file         |
| Owner     | `rwx`  | Read, write, execute |
| Group     | `r-x`  | Read, execute only   |
| Others    | `r--`  | Read only            |
# Numeric (Octal) Representation:
###
| Symbolic | Binary | Octal | Meaning         |
| -------- | ------ | ----- | --------------- |
| `---`    | 000    | 0     | No permissions  |
| `--x`    | 001    | 1     | Execute only    |

# Common Chmod Examples:
###
| Command          | What It Does                                 |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `chmod 755 file` | Owner: all, Group & Others: read + execute   |
| `chmod 700 file` | Only owner can read, write, execute          |
| `chmod 644 file` | Owner: read/write, Group & Others: read only |
| `chmod 777 file` | Everyone can read, write, and execute        |
| `chmod 000 file` | No one can do anything (locked)              |
#### .Chmod444: chmod444 myself.sh(permission to read only for everywhere)
![copyImage](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d181d453-fe45-4930-b7e0-86d18a5700ff)
.chmod644(permission to only owner.
#### .chown:

# Redirection:
## .Allow you to change input or output of combined
## .Echo hello > day3.txt
## .Redirect the message from hello to day3.txt
## .Operations -> (standard output), >> <(standard input)
# Pipes:
## .Take output from one command and pass it to another command
## .Particular file in folder
## .Example: you have many files in folder but you want only file that ends with .sh
## Types of Pipes:
# .Pipes are two types
1. Unnamed pipes - created using pipe()
2. Named Pipes - special file created with mkfilo and can be used for related communication
# Shell Program:
1. use of variables
## -> Input:
